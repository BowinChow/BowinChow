- 👋 Hi, I’m @BowinChow
- 👀 I’m interested in Morphometrics, a multivate statistical tool for analyzing shapes and soft morphoing robtics! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++/Machine Learning/Deep Learning/statistical analysis/Geometric Differetial/Matrix...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the application of outline geometric morphometrics via Fourier transforms and other algotithms.
